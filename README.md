# README #

This is a C# Class Library project that contains example code from the NSubstitute tutorials from github: http://nsubstitute.github.io/

I worked through these to get used to NSubstitute having previously used Moq

To get started pull or fork this repo, build it, update the nuget packages (should be set to restore automatically, but check just in case)

To run the tests right click on the Tests folder and run 'em

Enjoy!
